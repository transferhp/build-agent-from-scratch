# Building Agent without Frameworks (e.g. LangChain, CrewAI)


The limitions of using exsiting frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI) to build an agent:

* They introduce an **extra layer of abstraction**, hiding crucial details from the developer.
* They make you **dependent on their ecosystem**, **updates**, and **potential limitations**.
* They **limit flexibility**, forcing you to work within their predefined structures rather than tailoring solutions to your exact needs.

The repo contains examples of building effective agents with *ONLY* LLM API and Python.
